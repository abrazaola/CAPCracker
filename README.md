# md5_brutus
MD5 Hash generator and cracker by:
- Sergio Anguita @zerjioang
- Aitor Brazaola @kronosnhz

This is the project files of subject "Computaci√≥n de altas prestaciones" of
University of Deusto.

There are different programs inside of this project based on the technology
* Sequential based
* OpenMP

Under sequential approach are the following ones:
* Hasher (Based on existing algorithm from the net)
* Cracker (Developed by our own)

In OpenMP currently is only the hasher.

All programs have their own makefile to ease the process of compiling and
running except the hasher.

# Compilation
## Hasher
These are the steps needed to compile
```
gcc -c cracker.c md5_hasher.c md5_hasher.h
gcc cracker.o md5_hasher.o -o md5_brutus
clear
```
# Usage
## Generate all pin code for length 1
### Input
```
./md5_brutus 1 1 numeric
```
### Output
```
	execution_path:	./md5_brutus
	min_size:	1
	max_size:	1
	charset:	numeric
	Selected charset by user is numeric
	Selected charset is NUMERIC
		Key min is: 1
		Key max is: 1
		Final key space is:	10

```

## Cracker
Go to cracker's directory (sequential or OpenMP)
```
make
make run
```

For clean the directory
```
make clean
```

### Output
Sequential with ```c20ad4d76fe97759aa27a0c99bff6710``` as example input and max
size 2
```
